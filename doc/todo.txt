- lz4 compression isn't working
- create a pipelineNew( filter, ..., filter) which links them all together.
- conversionFilter - look at pgbackrest APIs for filter. How easy to borrow code?
- O_DIRECT and async I/O?
- update unit tests to only issue multiples of blocksize.
- separate unit tests for each filter/pipeline.
- add isReadable, isWriteable, isOpen to header, so passThroughXXX can do some simple error handling (instead of each filter)
- Converter: change names begin->init, convert->update, end->final  to match openSSL vocabulary.
